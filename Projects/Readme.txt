LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THE PERSONAL PROJECTS

The AI4ALL personal project is meant to give students a chance to apply the algorithms theyâ€™ve been reading and learning about. 
The project is meant to be applied in nature. Students are not asked to develop their own algorithms.

This personal project aims to develop practical coding skills:
* Learning how to adapt code someone else has written for a new purpose or new dataset
* Learning how to identify problems they are encountering and research solutions via provided links or other forums

Implementing the Personal Project with Students

We will ask you to  work in small groups on this personal project. 
However, each of you should create your own copy of the personal project notebook to work in. 
This project should provide ALL students with hands-on coding practice, although you may strongly benefit from discussions 
about how to navigate data exploration and feature selection with fellow students or instructors.

The personal project includes several sections plus one optional section:

Exploring the data
Feature Engineering
Unsupervised Machine Learning (Clustering)
K-Means
Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)
Naive Bayes
SVM
Decision Tree
Neural Network
Optional: Web scraping

To start, students should make a copy of the personal project files. This way, they can always return to the clean file for code that works. 

You may want extra support on subjects such as:
Cleaning data (e.g., dealing with missing data)
Ideas for feature engineering
Feature selection
Iterative refinement of input variables and model selection
Tuning models (if time - this is not included in the notebook)
Evaluation of models and comparison between models
